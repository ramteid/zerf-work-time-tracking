Self-hosted time tracking for kindergartens.


KitaZeit lets a team record working hours, request leave,
get approvals, and produce monthly reports — without the fuss of a payroll
suite. The whole thing runs from one `docker compose up`.

---

## Why use it

- **Quick to learn.** Simple work-time forms, calm interface, sensible defaults.
- **Mobile-first.** Educators record their hours from a phone in the cloakroom.
- **Self-hosted.** Your data stays on your server. No SaaS, no telemetry.
- **Operable.** Caddy, the app, and PostgreSQL ship as one compose stack with hardened defaults.

## What you get

| Role | What they can do |
|------|------------------|
| Employee | Log hours per category, request vacation, report sick days, ask to reopen a submitted week, see own balance |
| Team lead | Approve/decline timesheets, leave, change & reopen requests; team calendar; reports; manage own approval policy |
| Admin | Manage users, categories, holidays; audit log; reset passwords; manage all approval policies |

Built-in workflows include weekly time-entry submission, approvals, change
requests for already-submitted entries, week reopen requests with
optional auto-approval per approver, persistent in-app notifications
(plus opt-in email), vacation balance tracking, public holidays for
Baden-Württemberg, an overtime ledger, and CSV exports.

A short tour of the UI:

- **Time** — week view, one row per category, today highlighted, single-tap "submit week"; once submitted, a **Request edit** button lets the employee ask to reopen the week for corrections.
- **Absences** — one form per type (vacation, sick, training, special leave, unpaid).
- **Calendar** — month view of who is away, colour-coded by type.
- **Dashboard** — team leads see all open approvals in one place, including a dedicated *Week reopen requests* queue.
- **Reports** — monthly per-employee, team summary, category breakdown, CSV.
- **Team Settings** *(team leads & admins)* — toggle "auto-approve reopens" per user to skip manual review for that person's reopen requests.
- **Admin** — users, categories, holidays, audit log.
- **Notification center** — bell in the sidebar with unread count; lists reopen-request events, approvals, rejections.

### How week reopen works

1. After an employee submits a week, the **Submit Week** button is replaced
   by a **Request edit** action.
2. If the employee has *Auto-approve reopens* enabled (set under **Team
   Settings** by a team lead or admin), the week is reopened immediately —
   every non-draft entry returns to `draft` and any open per-entry change
   requests for that week are auto-cancelled.  The designated approver and
   all admins receive an informational notification.
3. Otherwise the request is queued. The designated approver and all admins
   receive an in-app notification (and an email when SMTP is configured),
   and any of them can approve or reject from the Dashboard. The employee
   gets the corresponding follow-up notification.

Each employee **must** have an approver assigned (Team lead or Admin); the
selector in the user dialog is mandatory and the schema enforces this.

## Install

**Prerequisites:**

- Linux host with Docker
- For public mode: a domain name pointing at the host, with ports 80 and 443 open

### Local vs Public operation

KitaZeit supports two compose modes:

| Mode | Command | What runs | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local (no internet edge) | `./start_local.sh` | App + PostgreSQL (`docker/docker-compose-local.yml`) | Local smoke tests, internal environments, or when you provide your own reverse proxy/TLS outside this repo |
| Local debug | `./start_local_debug.sh` | App + PostgreSQL (`docker/docker-compose-local.yml` + `docker/docker-compose-local-debug.yml`) | Local browser/backend debugging with a debug Rust binary and unminified frontend assets |
| Public (internet-facing) | `./start_public.sh` | App + PostgreSQL + Caddy (`docker/docker-compose-local.yml` + `docker/docker-compose-public.yml`) | Normal production deployment on a public host |

Important differences:

- **Public mode** publishes ports `80` and `443` via Caddy and handles automatic Let's Encrypt certificates.
- **Local mode** does not start Caddy, publishes the app directly on `http://localhost:3000`, and does not publish 80/443 from this stack.
- In both modes, PostgreSQL stays on an internal Docker network.

### 1) Common setup (both modes)

Clone and create `.env`:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> kitazeit && cd kitazeit
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env
```

Generate secrets:

```bash
sed -i "s|KITAZEIT_SESSION_SECRET=.*|KITAZEIT_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|" .env
sed -i "s|KITAZEIT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=.*|KITAZEIT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|" .env
```

Set required values in `.env`:

- `KITAZEIT_ADMIN_EMAIL` is required in all modes.
- `KITAZEIT_DOMAIN` is required for public mode.

```bash
$EDITOR .env
```

### 2) Start in your mode

Public mode (internet-facing, HTTPS via Caddy):

```bash
./start_public.sh
docker compose logs -f app   # watch until "listening on …"
```

Local mode (internal/local operation without Caddy):

```bash
./start_local.sh
docker compose logs -f app
```

Local debug mode (debug Rust build, frontend sourcemaps, no frontend minification):

```bash
./start_local_debug.sh
docker compose logs -f app
```

In local mode, open `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with your admin e-mail and password `admin`.

In local debug mode, open `http://localhost:3000`; backend symbols are kept, `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` is enabled, and the frontend build keeps readable JS chunks with sourcemaps.

In public mode, sign in at `https://<your-domain>` with your admin e-mail and password `admin`.
You will be prompted to change the password on first login.

### Configuration

Shared secrets and the bootstrap admin account live in `.env`; mode-specific
local/public behavior lives in the compose files. Summary of what matters in
`.env`:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `KITAZEIT_DOMAIN` | yes | Your public hostname |
| `KITAZEIT_ADMIN_EMAIL` | yes | Bootstrap admin account |
| `KITAZEIT_SESSION_SECRET` | yes | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `KITAZEIT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | yes | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `KITAZEIT_SMTP_HOST` | no | Leave unset to disable e-mail |

Caddy obtains a Let's Encrypt certificate automatically on first start. The
bundled PostgreSQL service stays on an internal Docker network and is never
published to the internet.

### Backups

```bash
# Daily snapshot at 03:00:
0 3 * * * cd /opt/kitazeit && /opt/kitazeit/scripts/backup.sh /opt/kitazeit/backups
```

The helper streams a `pg_dump` custom-format snapshot from the internal
PostgreSQL container. Set `BACKUP_GPG_RECIPIENT=<your-key>` to encrypt every
snapshot at rest.

### Updates

```bash
git pull && ./start_public.sh   # public mode
git pull && ./start_local.sh    # local mode
```

The schema migrates itself; no manual steps required.

## Security

KitaZeit is meant to live on the open internet. Hardening is documented in
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Highlights:

- Argon2id passwords, lockout after 5 failed attempts in 15 min.
- Session cookies HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict; 8 h idle / 24 h hard cap.
- CSRF: SameSite + Origin allow-list + double-submit `X-CSRF-Token`.
- PostgreSQL stays on an internal Docker network with SCRAM auth and data checksums.
- HSTS preload, full CSP, X-Frame-Options DENY, COOP/CORP same-origin.
- Container runs non-root with read-only rootfs and all capabilities dropped.
- 1 MiB body limit, 30 s request timeout, no sensitive data in logs.

If you find a vulnerability, please report it privately — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Development

The canonical regression suite is the Rust integration test in
[`backend/tests/integration.rs`](backend/tests/integration.rs:1) — every
business rule (validation, permissions, workflow transitions, response
shapes) is asserted there. The frontend has its own quality gates via
[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) under [`frontend/src/`](frontend/src/).

```bash
# Backend integration suite (requires DATABASE_URL)
cd backend && DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/postgres cargo test --test integration

# Frontend lint + format + tests + production build
cd frontend && npm install && npm run lint && npm run format && npm test && npm run build

```

CI ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml:1)) runs both on
every push: backend (fmt, clippy, build, integration tests, cargo-audit),
frontend (lint, format, Vitest, build, npm audit), plus Docker smoke, Trivy,
and CodeQL (JavaScript) jobs.

| Path | What's there |
|------|--------------|
| [`backend/`](backend/) | Rust + Axum + PostgreSQL — owns all business rules |
| [`frontend/`](frontend/) | Svelte + Vite SPA — thin client that renders backend-shaped state |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | PostgreSQL backup helper |

## Roadmap (out of scope for v1)

Payroll integration, SSO/LDAP, native mobile app,
multi-tenant — all deliberately *not* built. The whole point is to stay small
and easy to operate.

## Changelog

### Per-user auto-approve reopens (2026-05-04)

The "Auto-approve reopens" setting has been reworked. Previously the flag
lived on the **approver** and controlled whether *all of that approver's
employees* could skip the manual review step. It now lives on every individual
**user** and expresses whether *that person's* own reopen requests are
auto-approved.

**What changed**

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Flag owner | Approver (team lead / admin) | Every active user |
| Who can set it | Admin only (own row) / lead (own row only) | Admin (any user) / team lead (themselves + their direct reports) |
| Team Settings view | Admins: lead + admin rows only; leads: own row only | Admins: all active users; leads: themselves + their direct reports |
| Auto-approve trigger | Approver's flag is `true` | Requester's own flag is `true` |
| Who is notified on auto-approve | Requester only | Requester + designated approver + all admins |
| Who is notified on pending request | Single designated approver | Designated approver + all admins |
| Admin approves/rejects a lead's queue item | Lead not notified | Lead receives an informational notification |

**Notification behaviour**

All reopen-workflow notifications are delivered both **in-app** (notification
center) and **via email** when SMTP is configured, consistent with all other
notification events in the app.

**Approver resolution for access control**

An admin is implicitly an approver for every non-admin user, regardless of
whether they are the user's explicitly assigned `approver_id`. This means:

- Any admin can approve or reject any pending reopen request.
- Any admin can set the auto-approve flag for any user.
- Team leads can only manage themselves and the users whose `approver_id` is set to them.
